# Coproloops

## About
The COPROLOOPS simulation system is aimed at modeling and simulating
(circular) production networks and estimate the effects of **strategic decisions**.
It provides tools for modeling **dynamic network** behavior, such as opening
and closing facilities, increasing demand and ramp-up production, as well as
**disturbances** in production and transportation.
